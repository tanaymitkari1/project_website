          more about yourself and your research aspirations so that you can establish a link with him/her 
          in your first conversation. Your first impression with a draft of your research interests is only
           going to help you with a prospective guide to
           your choice. Make sure your guide is interested in your topic and you can get along with him.

        <p>
          Research proposal explains the significance of the proposed research. It critically analyzes the existing research problems and identifies the gaps to focus on the solutions. The proposal is a concrete and convincing framework of a Ph.D. that highlights the originality of the study. The creativity of the problem and illustrates what critical thinking and skills used to prove or disprove the problem. It articulates the correct methodology to conduct the study and offers logical reasons why this particular method is selected. The proposal provides the potential for the work and what are the implications involved in it and eventually explains how the proposed solution is going to bridge the gap in the existing knowledge. Also, how the proposed work will contribute and what is the findings over prospects after the completion of the research work. The research proposal demonstrates the significance and the quality of the research as well as reflects the capability of the researcher to conduct the research.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Literature Survey :
        </h1>
        <p>
          A literature survey offers an overview, critical evaluation, and significant contributions of the published work on a research topic.
